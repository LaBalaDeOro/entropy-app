<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Terms of Service</h1>

By purchasing an Ashlar device and registering it using our provisioning
software, you acknowledge that you are joining a playful, experimental web3
mining community with no guarantee of profit or fixed rules&mdash;participation
is at your own risk and the network's rules may change at any time. We stand
behind the craftsmanship of the device with a like-for-like guarantee if you
fail to make a single successful claim. Beyond that, you assume all liability
for network penalties (for example, operating more than five devices) or any
malicious acts you commit. There is no direct link between the entropy you
generate and token value&mdash;we will not use your entropy to boost the token
or benefit ourselves. Any value that emerges is set solely by network
participants. This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
